        <h2> Static Website </h2> 
        <iframe src="https://sethclydesdale.github.io/genki-study-resources/lessons/appendix/dictionary/#section-%E3%81%8A" width="300" height="300" frameborder="0" title="Genki Dictionary" ></iframe> 
        <p> This is one of my favorite websites to use for my language class. It's mainly a static website because the information because it just calls
            upon the files once to load in the site and information. I like it because it looks clean, there are multiple search functions, and it is 
            simple to use. I also love it's responsive design. But, I don't like that the words are limited to the ones studied in the Genki textbooks. They also have to be
            put exactly as they are found in the book, or the result won't come up. Also my link always jumps to the middle of the page. </p>

        <h2> Dynamic Wesbite </h2> 
        <iframe name="frame" src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=lizzyjace%40gmail.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" title="Google Calendar"></iframe>
        <p> I think my favorite dynamic website is Google Calendar. Though I have only tried about 3 other calendars,
            I found that this one is the easiest to work with. It is dynamic as it is changing with user input, follows
            real-time which enables users to set reminders and tasks, and users can share calendars to view them alongside with their own 
            calendars. You can also invite users to an event through the site. I enjoy the calendar sharing feature, and I use it often to manage my time more easily. 
            I also like that I can add different types of calendars, and toggle their view on/off, instead of having entirely different calendar pages
            for each. I do wish they had more color options though, we are limited to about 10 colors to use in our calendars.
